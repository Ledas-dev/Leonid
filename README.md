Not much information about me

About me
I was developing personal projects in a small team (Based on the CTFd platform, they made an international hackathon for white hat hackers. https://2024.cr3c.tf/
In it, I made a landing page and redesigned the user interface).

I took part in hackathons, I have a certificate of prize place.

I highly value team spirit, joint recreation, building a friendly atmosphere in the team. I can conduct games in the tabletop role-playing game DnD :)
